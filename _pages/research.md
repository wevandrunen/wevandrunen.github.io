My research is motivated by two broad questions, and the intersection between them:
1. What are the eco-evolutionary causes and consequences of polyploidy?  
2. How do sexual and asexual reproduction via clonal growth interact, and how does investment in clonal reproduction affect fitness?   

# What are the eco-evolutionary causes and consequences of polyploidy in natural systems?

Polyploidy (3 or more chromosome sets) is remarkably common among plants; approximately 35% of extant flowering-plant species are polyploid, and __all__ have experienced at least one ancient whole-genome duplication (WGD) event. Despite its high frequency of occurrence in this group, the role of polyploidy in the ecology and evolution of plant species is understudied, especially in non-crop/non-model systems. I concentrate on the impact of phenotypic divergence between diploids and polyploids, in both natural populations and urban environments.

## Phenotypic Shifts in Neopolyploids

![image-right](../assets/images/Dip and tet2 small.jpg){: .align-right} Autopolyploids (polyploids arising within a single species) frequently exhibit divergent phenotypes from their diploid parents (e.g., plant size, see diploid vs. neotetraploid _Fragaria vesca_ on the right). Changes can happen immediately following the WGD event, or they may arise over many generations if cytotypes are subject to different selective pressures. But since newly arisen neo-polyploids are only rarely observed in nature, we often can't disentangle the short- vs. long-term effects of WGD on individual phenotypes. 
<br>
<br>
During my PhD at the University of Guelph, I used synthetic lab-generated neopolyploids in the first studies to to quantify the immediate effects of WGD on investment in clonal reproduction. I found that the effects of WGD on clonality differ both within ([Van Drunen & Husband 2018a](https://doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.1159 )), and between species ([Van Drunen & Husband 2018b](https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcy071)). Furthermore, patterns of clonal reproduction in naturally-occuring tetraploid _Chamerion angustifolium_ were more similar to diploids than to synthetic neotetraploids! These studies suggest that phenotypic effects of WGD are complex, context dependent, and may result in considerable variation among neopolyploids.

Current research with _Mimulus guttatus_ is exploring the effects of WGD on life history and phenological traits.

## Reproduction, Life History Strategies, and Polyploid Establishment

Polyploid establishment in diploid populations is constrained by Minority Cytotype Exclusion (MCE), where rare polyploids have low fitness relative to diploids because most of their mating opportunities are between-cytotype. Species with traits that help overcome MCE are expected to produce successful polyploids. Many traits have been postulated to alleviate MCE (e.g., self-fertilization, assortative mating, asexual reproduction), but the mechanisms behind success or failure in the establishment process have proven difficult, or impossible, to study in natural populations.

<br>
I am particularly interested in the impact of reproductive and life history strategies on polyploid success. I combine fieldwork with experimental, theoretical, and computational methods to obtain a fuller picture of the role of these strategies in polyploid establishment.
<br>
<br> 
Comparative phylogenetic analyses I conducted on a large angiosperm-wide data set ([Van Drunen & Husband 2019](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.15999)) revealed variable evolutionary relationships between clonal reproduction and polyploidy across major clades, and further suggest that the relationship between these two traits is strongly confounded with perenniality. In my postdoc at Queen's University, I have developed agent-based simulation models with explicit spatial structure to contrast the role of clonal reproduction vs. life history in polyploid establishment (Van Drunen & Friedman, _in prep_; see simulation schematic below).

## Polyploid vs. Diploid Species in Urban Environments
![image-right](../assets/images/inaturalis.jpg){: .align-right} Urban areas are predicted to be hotspots of polyploid speciation, and fast-growing urban landscapes offer a unique chance to observe polyploid formation and evolution on a contemporary timescale. For example, differences in tolerance to urban environments between diploid and polyploid species may result in biogeographical shifts, as diploids are outcompeted and displaced by polyploids over time. This process may be compounded by a human-driven increase in invasive, horticultural, and commensal species in urban areas, many of which are polyploid. Changes in community-level ploidy variation could greatly affect ecological interactions (e.g., pollinators), and ultimately influence how plants respond to urban environments and global change.

I am currently analyzing large GTA-based datasets from several sources: (1) ~8,000 records of 717 species from community science platform iNaturalist (2018-2019). The figure on the right shows this data for two clover species (_Trifolium_), using distance to urban centre as a measure of urbanization; (2) Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) survey data and ~95,000 point observations; and (3) Specimens in the ROM Green Plant Herbarium between the years 1838-2020.

# Reproductive Strategies in Clonal Plants

## The Fitness Consequences of Clonality
Asexual reproduction via clonality occurs through the vegetative production of daughter shoots, genetically identical to the mother plant.
