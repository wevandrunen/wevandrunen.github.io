## Phenotypic Shifts in Neopolyploids

{: .align-left} Autopolyploids (polyploids arising within a single species) frequently exhibit divergent phenotypes from their diploid parents (e.g., plant size, see diploid vs. neotetraploid _Fragaria vesca_ on the right). Changes can happen immediately following the whole-genome duplication (WGD) event, or they may arise over many generations if cytotypes are subject to different selective pressures. But since newly arisen neo-polyploids are only rarely observed in nature, we often can't disentangle the short- vs. long-term effects of WGD _per se_ on individual phenotypes. This means that the phenotypic changes that occur in neopolyploids during the critical establishment period just-post-WGD are largely unknown.

![](../assets/images/dip and tet2 small.jpg){: .align-right} During my PhD at the University of Guelph, I used synthetic lab-generated neopolyploids in the first studies to to quantify the immediate effects of WGD on investment in clonal reproduction (asexual reproduction via vegetative growth). I found that the effects of WGD on clonality differ both within ([Van Drunen & Husband 2018a](https://doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.1159 )), and between species ([Van Drunen & Husband 2018b](https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcy071)). Furthermore, patterns of clonal reproduction in naturally-occuring tetraploid _Chamerion angustifolium_ were more similar to diploids than to synthetic neotetraploids!
<br>
<br>
These studies suggest that phenotypic effects of WGD are complex, context dependent, and may result in considerable variation among neopolyploids. However, the impact of this variation on neopolyploids in natural populations remain undetermined.

Current research with _Mimulus guttatus_ is exploring the effects of WGD on life history and phenological traits.
