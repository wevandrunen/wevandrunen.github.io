excerpt: Evolutionary Ecologist, PhD <br> Botanical & Natural History Illustrator 
# <br> __Dr. Wendy E. Van Drunen__ <br>

intro:
  - excerpt: My scientific research explores the evolution and ecology of polyploid plants in both natural populations and urban ecosystems, with an emphasis on interactions between whole-genome duplication (WGD), polyploidy, and reproductive strategies. I use a variety of quantitative approaches; combining field work, experiments, phylogenetic analysis, computational methods, and theoretical models. <br> <br> I am also an artist and certified botanical illustrator. Check out some of my work on the gallery page! <br> <br>
