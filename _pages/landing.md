    excerpt: <br> <br> <font size="10"> Hello! </font> <br> <br> My research explores the evolution and ecology of polyploid plants in both natural populations and urban ecosystems, with an emphasis on interactions between whole-genome duplication (WGD), polyploidy, and reproductive strategies. I use a variety of quantitative approaches; combining field work, experiments, phylogenetic analysis, computational methods, and theoretical models. <br> <br> I am also a natural history artist and certified botanical illustrator. I emphasize the ecological and evolutionary stories of plants in my art. My goal is to use my paintings for science communication, by engaging people with the beauty of nature and creating personal connections with the plants in our everyday lives.  Check out some of my work on the gallery page! <br> <br>
