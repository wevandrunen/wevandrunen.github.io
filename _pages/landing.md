    excerpt: <br> <br> <br> <br> <font size="10" colour="red"> <span style="color:black"> <strong> <em>Hello!</em> </strong> </span> </font> <br> <br> <br> <br> I'm Wendy, an evolutionary ecologist and artist. <br> <br> Since I was young, I've always loved both science and art. <br> <br> In university I ended up pursuing science, and graduated with a B.Sc. joint major in Physics & Biology. What an odd combination! Well, I started out as a physics major, then in my third year realized that every elective I took was a biology course. Then I took a course on plant evolution, and that was it. I was hooked. <br> <br> My research explores the evolution and ecology of polyploid plants in both natural populations and urban ecosystems, with an emphasis on interactions between whole-genome duplication (WGD), polyploidy, and reproductive strategies. I use a variety of quantitative approaches; combining field work, experiments, phylogenetic analysis, computational methods, and theoretical models. <br> <br> I am also a natural history artist and certified botanical illustrator. I emphasize the ecological and evolutionary stories of plants in my art. My goal is to use my paintings for science communication, by engaging people with the beauty of nature and creating personal connections with the plants in our everyday lives.  Check out some of my work on the gallery page! <br> <br>
