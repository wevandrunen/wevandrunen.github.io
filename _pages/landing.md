    title: "About Me"
    excerpt: My research focuses on the evolution and ecology of polyploid plants in natural and urban systems. I use a variety of quantitative approaches, combining computational (theory, simulation modeling, phylogenetic analyses, mand analysis of large public, pre-published, and community science datasets) and empirical methods (field studies, large-scale experiments in common gardens and natural populations).
