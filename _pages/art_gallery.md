I primarily work in watercolour and acrylic, taking inspiration from the natural world -- especially plants! Through my artwork I hope to convey some of the wonderful biology and nature that surrounds us every day, but that we may not always take the time to stop and really see. <br><br> Please do not use any images without permission. <br><br>
