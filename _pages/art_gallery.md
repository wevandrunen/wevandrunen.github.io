I primarily work in watercolour and gouache, taking inspiration from the natural world -- especially plants! Through my artwork I hope to show some of the wonderful biology and nature that surrounds us every day, but that we may not always take the time to stop and really see. <br><br> Check out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/we.vandrunen.art/) to see what I'm currently working on! <br><br>
